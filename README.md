## Instructions

To get started, open `designs.js` and start building out the app's functionality.

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build
the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user
create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply
colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1.	Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2.	Choose a color.
3.	Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
